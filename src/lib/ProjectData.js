			"Pick & Play is a vinyl collector's community, offering a platform to buy and sell used vinyl, exchange information about analog music, and consume curated content. Unlike the United States, which maintained a robust community of vinyl enthusiasts even during the decline of analog music, South Korea lacked such space. Thus, Pick & Play addresses the unique challenges faced by young generation Korean vinyl collectors."
